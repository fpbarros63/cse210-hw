        EXCEED REQUIREMENTS:
        1) Added a small scripture library (multiple scriptures) and randomly selects one each run.
        2) Improved the hiding logic to choose only from words not yet hidden (stretch challenge).
        3) Hides a configurable number of words per step, based on remaining visible words.
